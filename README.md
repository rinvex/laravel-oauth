## Usage

Given it's built upon [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/passport), it's following most of the included features, and could be used in a very similar way, but still it has some differences. Documentation is not ready yet, so rely on official [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/passport) docs for now, and make sure to check the code for any differences.
